/// Fa√ßade over any implementation of synchronous operations on an underlying data layer kept in sync with the client.
/// This has a publisher which a client can subscribe to in order to observe the latest changes made to the underlying data.
/// This ensures a clean MVVM architecture can be set up.
///
/// Options for implementation include but are not limited to:
/// - No persistence, storing the non-encoded data in RAM
/// - User Defaults, holding encoded objects as data
/// - Core Data, storing data as NSManagedObject
///
/// A version of this protocol with async methods could be created to represent data stored on a server and kept in sync with the client.
/// In a more complex application, this data layer would also operate using generics rather than a concrete ToDo type.
